## Known Issues

- Posts with invalid timestamps in `data.json` may cause filtering errors.
- The application currently uses a JSON file for storage, which is not suitable for production.

## Future Enhancements

- **Database Integration:** Replace `data.json` with a proper database like SQLite or PostgreSQL.
- **User Accounts:** Add optional user authentication for non-anonymous features.
- **Improved Filtering:** Include more robust filtering options and sorting criteria (e.g., keyword search).
